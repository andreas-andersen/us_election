## (shiny) Map of US Presidential Election results and economic data

![Map Preview](/images/preview.png)

This is my github repository for my shiny app.

The map displays election results and economic data (median income and unemployment) in the period 2000 - 2020 (2019 for economic data).
The income and density plots is an attempt at visualizing the distribution of "rich" and "poor" counties across the two major parties.

The app is coded in R.
Map is created with leaflet and graphs with plotly.
